# Multivariable Calculus
**Single variable** function: f(x) = x² , 
whereas **multi-variable** function: 
f(x,y) = x² + y. (point on xy graph) (x-y point to a number) [also called single variable calculus]

In multivariable o/p can vector: f(x,y) = [ 3x / 2y ] (x-y point gives vector result - point to a vector [result as vector or matrix]

### x-y point as input to function gives graph as result - example :

## Dot product & Cross product
1) dot product returns a number but cross product returns vector
2) dot product works in any number of dimensions, cross porduct works only in 3d
3) dot product measures how much two **vector point in same direction**. cross product measures how much **two vectors point in different direction**.

## Matrix
### Matrix Transpose

## Vector as matrices
vector is just a list of numbers. We can write vector as matrices in either (1 x n) format or (n x 1) format

vedtor can be written a 1 x n - one row and n column - example - 1x 3 -  [1,4,5] (one row, n column). ABove transposed to n x 1 (n row, 1 column)

# Interactive version - i j  define plane. Vector gets multiplied on this place

## Point in 3D
# f(x,y) = x² + y²

# f(x,y) = 1/4 x² + 1/4 y²
