# Multivariable Calculus
**Single variable** function: f(x) = x² , 
whereas **multi-variable** function: 
f(x,y) = x² + y. (point on xy graph) (x-y point to a number) [also called single variable calculus]

In multivariable o/p can vector: f(x,y) = [ 3x / 2y ] (x-y point gives vector result - point to a vector [result as vector or matrix]

### x-y point as input to function gives graph as result - example :

## Dot product & Cross product
1) dot product returns a number but cross product returns vector
2) dot product works in any number of dimensions, cross porduct works only in 3d
3) dot product measures how much two **vector point in same direction**. cross product measures how much **two vectors point in different direction**.
